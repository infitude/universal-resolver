### Information

This is a work-in-progress **dotnet core** implementation of a Universal Resolver (aka Community Resolver) to be used for a decentralized naming system. It includes core resolution logic, a web API, a client library, and drivers for the **did:sov**, **did:btcr**, and **did:stack** methods (TBC).

See the [specifications](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/api-documentation.md) for more information.

Incomplete implementation! Not ready for production use! Use at your own risk! Pull requests welcome.

### Quick Start

Install dotnet core 2.x SDK for your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) from www.microsoft.com/net/download/core

Open up a comand prompt, check the installation with **dotnet --version**

You can deploy the Universal Resolver on your local machine by cloning this Github repository, open the Visual Studio solution file to build and run the Universal Resolver as well as its drivers:

	git clone https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver.git
